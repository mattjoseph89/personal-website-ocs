      <p>My name is Matt Wurth. I am currently contracted through Omaha Code School as a full stack developer. My client is Hear Nebraska, a local non-profit striving to establish Omaha as a cultural destination. My project is to develop a digital vinyl archive for artists that have produced within Nebraska .</p>
</br>
        <p> My professional development began with a bachelors degree studying Marketing Strategy from UNO. I am highly passionate about design, and how it influences humanity. I am particularly interested in brand development as a whole; everything from logo design and wireframes to website development and interaction to create a totally immersed brand experience. This fascination began with the realization that brand identity influences emotional connection. </p>
</br>
        <p>A prominement example would be Coca-Cola. The product is merely a classic looking sugar filled beverage, but through proper marketing execution it has become so much more. When I see (and occasionally drink) a beverage from Coca-Cola, I think of the warmth I felt seeing a lit up semi traveling down a snowy highway, I hear uplifting jingles, I giggle at the thought of a polar bear wearing a scarf and I feel a connection to the brands history with all of their memorabilia. This is the kind of experience I want to create for the world. I believe I can most effectively execute this as a Web Developer, and I am thoroughly enjoying my experiences thus far. </p>
</br>
        <p>I love meeting new people, discussing ideas, and learning about current events within the tech industry. I will also completely unravel if you prompt me on anything related to string theory (and I succumb to cheap puns on the regular.) Please feel free to reach out to me in any fashion!</p>
