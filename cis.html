						Through and through, I am a designer. I am known by everyone  as the "...what if we tried this" guy - and for the most part, when I propose such an idea, it sticks. My design roles over the years have manifested in many ways,
					    however, nothing has captivated my interest as much as web development. My disposition is to spend my time immersed in front-end systems, obsessing over the intricacies of responsive design, ensuring the most seamless and intuitive user experience possible. My current muse is studying animation platforms such as GreenSock. I am also passionate about taking on back-end challenges, and thoroughly enjoy the satisfaction of properly organized and documented code. I am endlessly excited by the learning opportunities within this industry and look forward to the collective future that is being built within the world of code.

						You are the leaders in cybersecurity. You provide protection for society in ways that they can't even comprehend, and do it in a fashion that is quite humble. The software you are developing is imperative for the sole functions of your organization and attention to detail is of utmost importance. Your databases need to be as flawless as your user interface to ensure maximun efficiency for all users. You need someone with follow through and awareness of priority. You need someone with a drive to be on the forefront of new technologies and frameworks, and to document their work extensively to ensure that nothing slips through the cracks. I believe that I am the developer you need.

				<h2> Why Me </h2>	
				<div class="row3"></div>
				<div class="row2"></div>
				<div class="row1"></div>
					<p class="textbox">
						I want to work for a company with a greater purpose.  I believe we are entering into an age where people will be more web dependent than ever before, and they will look to you to keep their lives safe. The applications you develop are going to allow your clients the fastest and safest route to securing their information. That urgency is the motivation that I crave to work with excellence. I have always been a creative, and I believe that a piece of art is never truly finished. I have old canvases that have been painted, repainted, gouged, mended, sculpted and repurposed - the common factor? I never stop trying to perfect them. No matter how impeccable the code may seem, I strive to continuously refactor and rethink for improvements. I find the endless sea of learning within this industry empowering, and I would love to dedicate that research and producitivy to CIS.
