      <h2>Design Should Be Vulnerable</h2>

      <p> Whether I am the designer, the developer, or the client, I believe in the importance of feedback. Not the feedback that lands on a google review, or the feedback that's gossiped over at the bar after a bad day on the job. I believe in pure, receptive, unfiltered feedback; the only true catalyst for properly pruned human growth and development. </p>
    </br>

      <p> As a curator of any craft, we are producing for the sake of humanity. I could design fifty websites and spin them up something fancy, but what would it matter if nobody found them useful? It is easy within a feedback session to call someone out on their lack of knowledge or poor taste, but who does that benefit in the end? If we have confidence in our abilities, then no amount of critique should phase us. However, when feedback does strike emotional discord, that is when we always have a choice. A choice to grow, or a choice to stagnate. </p>
    </br>

      <p> I have met people within the industry who cringe at the thought of their clients having opinions about their work. There are a million cliche quotes that drown my mind overhearing these conversations. Mainly, "Don't bite the hands that feed you!?" If I summed up the truly exceptional design and development work I have seen thus far into one word it would be "Organic." Organic in the sense that it is completely and utterly accepted and integrated into societal processes in the natural world. It is a design that makes you think "Oh, why hasn't this always looked like this, or worked like that?!" That is the kind of design that we should all be striving for. It will outlive the rest definitively. </p>
    </br>

      <p> What does this mean for feedback? Why are we so hesitant to receiving feedback? The stress that feedback almost always equates to more work probably has something to do with it, but what is the alternative? Especially if the same feedback is coming at you repeatedly, would it not be worth it to address the problem once and consequently grow from the turmoil? This is what I believe to be true. Here is another <a href="https://uxplanet.org/the-subtle-art-that-differentiates-good-designers-from-great-designers-1ad3557b4c4"><u>article</u></a> that can continue this conversation. </p>
